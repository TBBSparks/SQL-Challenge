# SQL-Challenge

Structured Query Language (SQL; pronounced "sequel") is a standard database management language for relational databases. SQL itself is not a programming language, but its standard allows creating procedural extensions for it, which extend it to the functionality of a mature programming language.  It is used for accessing and manipulating databases.
